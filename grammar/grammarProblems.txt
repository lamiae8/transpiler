Target ressource definition still bugs when using simples target like "ressource", it only works with complex ones like "ressource.id".

To avoid this problem, change 'ressource' to 'ressource.', and everything will be fine.

All the "value == value" should be either numerical or strings.

on deny {
   advice ObligationAdvice.reasonForDeny { 
   Attributes.message = "There is no care relation"

Doesnt recognize the "There is no care relation" as a string... God knows why.

Target clause Problems :

		* 1- This translator doesnt make the difference between 'and' and 'or' blocks, it gathers them in a struct regardless of their type.
		*
		* 2- a target clause definition with multiple clause definitions will not be interpreted
		* 	for example : target clause test. == "read" and rest. != "write"
		* 	only the first clause will be translated.
		* 
		* 3- a target clause like :  target clause qt > 13 , or anything of a kind wont be translated. Specified clauses should be made in a condition ...
		*	
		* 4 - incomplete target clause definitions like : target clause , 
		*	will result in an empty 'require()' solidity block..
